# CodeCoach
A programming motivational prompt.

I've been struggling with procrastination for a few years now, and this has stopped me from practicing more
what I've been learning about programming since high school.
So I decided to fight coding procrastination... by creating a program that launches a YouTube link
after clicking a button, redirecting to "Stop Studying Programming" by bigboxSWE.
This video, no joke, actually motivated me and gave me this idea.

With this project I'm planning to learn some Javax Swing basics and how to create an executable Java program (.jar file).
